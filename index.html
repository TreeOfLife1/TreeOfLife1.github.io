                <h1>Tree Of Life Foundation</h1>
                <h4>To Our Dear Flatbush Family,</h4>
                <h4>It has always been said and has always been felt that we are part of a special club and share a special bond,
                    although some of us have never actually met in person. On November 5th, we lost one of our own, Naomi Houllou A"H.
                    It is an unfathomable loss to her family, her friends, our school and to the greater community at large.</h4>
                <h4>We are embarking on a heartfelt project that we hope all will participate. We are creating the Naomi Houllou A"H
                    Tree of Life in the Ladies Auxiliary office. This memorial is going to represent everything that Naomi stood for -
                    warmth, life, spirit, and of course, dedication to our precious children.</h4>
                <h4>The Tree of Life will have doves, butterflies and leaves, which will all be available for sponsorship open to the
                    entire parent body, administration and faculty. The trunk, which supports the upper part of the tree, will be a
                    message from Avi Houllou. For this endeavor, we are seeking a sponsorship in denominations of either $180, $360 or
                    $501. There will be doves that are $501, butterflies for $360, leaves for $180 each. On each item you have space
                    for 3 lines and up to 21 characters in each line.</h4>
                <h4>In addition to the sponsorships, every year there will be a nominating committee to select a "Volunteer of the Year".
                    This person will not be a member of the Ladies Auxiliary board. They will be honored with an intimate ceremony in the
                    Ladies Auxiliary office and a leaf will be inscribed with their name on it.</h4>
                <h4>Thank you for your participation and support!</h4>
